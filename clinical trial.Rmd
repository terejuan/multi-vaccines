Just looking at this date we can se that the pinck group had the lest chance of geting sic, because that group took the first and the new shot against the virus. the next best group would be the new group, they have a lowe chance of getting sick because they took the new vaccin only. After them follows the first group that only took the first vaccin against the viru. And the none group has a very hight chance of getting sick because they didnt take one or the other.

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected+ vaxStatus, data=newdata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

the group that didnt have the vaccine had a highter chance of getting infected with the virus compared to tose that took the first vaccine, the first and new vaccine and the group that only took the new vaccine. the group that had 6% of getting sick was the group that got the firs and the new vaccine.

                 fTempTable = as.matrix(fisherTable[fisherIndexX,
                                        fisherIndexY])
                 
                 fisherTest=fisher.test(fTempTable, conf.int = TRUE, 
                              conf.level = confLevel)
                 
                 if((fisherTest$p.value < (1-confLevel) ) || printAll){
                   
                       print(c(levelsX[i], levelsX[j]))
                       print(c(levelsY[k], levelsY[l]))
                       print(fTempTable)
                       print(fisherTest)
                       cat('\n')
                 }
                 
        }
}

```
```{r}
fisherXY(newdata$infected,newdata$vaxStatus,printAll = TRUE)
```

in the fiherXy we see that they are all different, we can see that first&new is the best way to go, then new is better then first, then first is better then non.
